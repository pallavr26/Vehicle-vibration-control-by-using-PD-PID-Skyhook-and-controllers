# Vehicle-vibration-control-by-using-PD-PID-Skyhook-and-controllers
PD, PID, Skyhook and ùêª‚àû controllers

This project deals with vibration control of vehicles i.e it deals with z-axis control. Various controllers are tested and tuned for simple excitations like step and sine functions. 

This project is a part of the course 'Advanced Vehicle Dynamics Control' taught at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. The course code SD-2221.

The project file is attached which contains the tasks for the project and the final report is attached which contains the results of all optimisations.
